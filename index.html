<p><strong>Organizers:</strong> <a href="http://censi.mit.edu">Andrea Censi</a> (MIT), <a href="http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/">Dylan Shell</a> (Texas A&amp;M), <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/~jokane">Jason O'Kane</a> (South Carolina), <a href="http://verifiablerobotics.com">Hadas Kress-Gazit</a> (Cornell), <a href="http://alexandroid000.github.io/index.html">Alexandra Nilles</a> (UIUC)</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Most fields of engineering are characterized by fundamental trade-offs between maximizing performance and minimizing resource usage; robotics is no exception. In robot design, trade-offs are distributed among subsystems such as sensing, actuation, computation, and power. A mathematical framework to describe these trade-offs does not yet exist.</p>
<p>The speakers and discussions in this workshop will focus on working toward formal representations that make automated reasoning and synthesis possible, and enable design choices beyond once-off, ad hoc solutions.</p>
<p>The workshop brings together roboticists with a variety of backgrounds to start to answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How can computers and software help us navigate the space of design decisions?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workshop includes both invited speakers and a call for presenters who:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>can share practical examples of resource-constrained robots and their performance envelopes;</p></li>
<li><p>are exploring abstractions and models which have promise as foundations for algorithmic design;</p></li>
<li><p>have novel and unconventional ideas for how to tame the computational complexities involved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The intended outcome of the workshop is a better understanding of how informal design decisions, including those exemplified in a custom design card game — played and discussed after lunch — can be refined and systematized so as to become fit for automation.</p>
