...

1. Type and Duration
--------------------

Full-day

2. Title
--------

Minimality and Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design

3. Organizers
-------------

For each organizer, provide: affiliation, address, phone, email, and
URL.

The organizers should include senior RAS members able to bring their
experience and their knowledge of the field to bear on the organization
and operation of the workshop.

Indicate which one of the organizers will be the primary contact person.

All correspondence will be sent to this contact person, who will be
expected to respond promptly.

4. URL
------

Organizers are required to maintain a website with information about
their workshop or tutorial.

The link to this website should be listed here. If possible, this link
should be active at the time of submission (in this case, the website
should indicate that it describes a "proposed workshop" or "proposed
tutorial").

However, organizers may, if they choose, wait until after their proposal
is accepted before creating the website.

2017 website.

----------

Describe your event in detail. Include a tentative schedule and a list
of invited speakers (if any), indicating topics and if their
participation is confirmed or still pending: briefly describe why
contributed presentations reflect the state of the art. ***These are the
main information which will be used to review the submission and its
scientific quality.***

7. Plan to solicit participation
--------------------------------

Describe how you will advertise and encourage participation in your
event, particularly from researchers traditionally outside of the
robotics community (if applicable). Steps that go beyond an email to
*roboticsworldwide* are encouraged. Estimate the number of participants
that you expect, and provide a basis for this estimate, such as
attendance at similar events in past years. If you have organized
similar events in the past, list them and provide the estimated
attendance at each.

8. Plan to encourage interaction among participants
---------------------------------------------------

Describe how you will promote active discussion. Steps that result in
participants staying for the entire event and that increase the level of
interaction between established experts and early-career researchers are
particularly welcome.

9. Dissemination
----------------

Describe briefly a dissemination plan of the outcome of the workshop. Solicitation of papers is encouraged by workshop organizers. These papers cannot take the form of conference paper submissions to be associated to the workshop. While they may be reviewed by the organizers prior to acceptance, they cannot be confused with regular, peer-reviewed, papers. RAS workshop papers cannot be published as peer reviewed papers. Specify the topics and why they would result compelling in providing a wide view of the state of the art. Paper Template downloadable on the IEEE RAS website.

Creation of an online accessible archive for discussions, media and
related articles is strongly encouraged: describe the process and how
access may be provided to participants and ICRA2017 attendees.

Organization of special issue in Tier 1 peer reviewed journals is
encouraged. Letter of support from Editors in Chief will be strongly
considered.
