Call for Speakers
-----------------

We are seeking speakers from a broad range of backgrounds to give 10-15 minute
talks on the subject of the workshop. If interested, [fill out the position
statement form
here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScltw1_U4jhXlZnhizx-tObBHE-vJM2XBLZ1pvh6GAuv09AZA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
You only need to write 2-3 paragraphs of text **total** in the position
statement.

Speakers who are chosen will get to become a card in the Robot Design Game
(described below), and will get two free decks of the game.

Description
-----------

Most fields of engineering are characterized by fundamental trade-offs between
maximizing performance and minimizing resource usage; robotics is no exception.
In robot design, trade-offs are distributed among subsystems such as sensing,
actuation, computation, and power. A mathematical framework to describe these
trade-offs does not yet exist.

The speakers and discussions in this workshop will focus on working toward
formal representations that make automated reasoning and synthesis possible, and
enable design choices beyond once-off, ad hoc solutions.

The workshop brings together roboticists with a variety of backgrounds to start
to answer the question:

> "How can computers and software help us navigate the space of design
> decisions?"

The workshop includes both invited speakers and a call for presenters who:

(1) can share practical examples of resource-constrained robots and their
performance envelopes;

(2) are exploring abstractions and models which have promise as foundations for
algorithmic design;

(3) have novel and unconventional ideas for how to tame the computational
complexities involved.

The intended outcome of the workshop is a better understanding of how informal
design decisions, including those exemplified in a custom design card game —
played and discussed after lunch — can be refined and systematized so as to
become fit for automation.

### Guiding questions

1. What would an ideal automated robot design process look like? What is the role
of human interaction with the tool? What techniques can we use from formal
methods or software engineering and human-computer interaction? The broader
design community? What is there to learn from the "maker" movement?
2. How can we parametrize (or otherwise abstract) robotic components,to avoid
hand-maintaining large component “libraries”? What are the pros and cons of
modular robotic components in automating design?
3. What are examples of robots achieving tasks with minimal resources? How can
these examples inform automatic design?
4. Are sensing, actuation, computation, communication and power the correct
categories for formalizing robotic resources? What are some first steps toward
formalizing resource trade-offs in robot design?
5. What are some interesting existing methods for formal specification of robot
functionality and task structure? What are the shortcomings of these methods?
6. What question is missing from this list?

### The Robot Design Game

[The Robot Design Game](http://robot-design.org), a game developed for RSS 2016
which seeks to explore the tradeoffs in resource constraints inherent in robot
design problems.  The game is based loosely on the [Iron
Chef](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/iron-chef-america.html).
