Description
-----------

Most fields of engineering are characterized by fundamental trade-offs between
maximizing performance and minimizing resource usage; robotics is no exception.
In robot design, trade-offs are distributed among subsystems such as sensing,
actuation, computation, and power. A mathematical framework to describe these
trade-offs does not yet exist.

The speakers and discussions in this workshop will focus on working toward
formal representations that make automated reasoning and synthesis possible, and
enable design choices beyond once-off, ad hoc solutions.

The workshop brings together roboticists with a variety of backgrounds to start
to answer the question:

> "How can computers and software help us navigate the space of design
> decisions?"

The workshop includes both invited speakers and a call for presenters who:

(1) can share practical examples of resource-constrained robots and their
performance envelopes;

(2) are exploring abstractions and models which have promise as foundations for
algorithmic design;

(3) have novel and unconventional ideas for how to tame the computational
complexities involved.

The intended outcome of the workshop is a better understanding of how informal
design decisions, including those exemplified in a custom design card game —
played and discussed after lunch — can be refined and systematized so as to
become fit for automation.

### The Robot Design Game

[The Robot Design Game](http://robot-design.org), a game developed for RSS 2016
which seeks to explore the tradeoffs in resource constraints inherent in robot
design problems.  The game is based loosely on the [Iron
Chef](http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/iron-chef-america.html).
